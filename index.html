                        Our technology and methods use special marketing leveraged alongside our custom “landing pages”
                        to get your followers
                        more engaged with our promoted resources, leading to more sales.

                        You must own a domain name for your active brand and
                        have control over the DNS so that you can point a subdomain to our servers. An example would be
                        having the ability to
                        point<br>
                        “swimwear.YOURDOMAIN.com” to the landing page that we’ll create together. For instance, if
                        you’ve registered your
                        domain through GoDaddy and you control or have access to the GoDaddy account, you qualify. We
                        can walk you through this
                        process through completion.
